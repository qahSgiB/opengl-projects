math util - functions for randomization with additive/mutltiplicative variance
non constant firework count
math util - add templates for linear mapping
firework - randimze fading and blinking

    [maybe]
do not mirror objects under mirror
    for particles done
    maybe also for normal objects
addaptive mirror texture size
find best hdr values
UBOVector - remove inheritence from OpenGLObject
firework - add non uniform randomization
firework - don't use muttiple buffers for firework pos, vel, acc, ..., use one buffer of structs
